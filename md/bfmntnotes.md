#### Hydrograph separation summary:

Baseflow boxplots and Baseflow index (BFI: the ratio of baseflow to total flow) are computed using the 14 hydrograph separation methods found in the `Hydrographs`->`(baseflow) separation` page. Monthly BFIs given by the monthly medians of calculated baseflow (from 14 hydrograph separation methods). 

Boxpots follow the method of McGill et.al. (1978): box represents the 25% to 75% quantile, while the centre line represents median (50% quantile). Whiskers represent the min and max observations or $\pm1.5\times\text{IQR}$ (inter-quartile range), whichever is less.
